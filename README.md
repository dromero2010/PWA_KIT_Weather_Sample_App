This is a modified version of Salesforce's Composable Storefront to include a bare-bones weather component. It's purpose is to demonstrate how to utilize React Query to make external API calls. An example of how this is done can be found in this webinar: https://salesforce.zoom.us/rec/component-page?action=viewdetailpage&sharelevel=meeting&useWhichPasswd=meeting&clusterId=us06&componentName=need-password&meetingId=aSso_GUCVKTtRG0404sjT1So3tZL-5L3SIe3v6QRRSjVRaB2Vkxu7d-Lsel3V0P0.--mLuYCWatEITysc&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsalesforce.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FPkJZnDpIqljU1s5L_xZeh6TMHt9qmzhOPTsuj99wkqUhyAifpLapaEcm061glyZh.cfn8jKi7H4JoFuuN

# The Retail React App

A project template that includes an isomorphic JavaScript storefront and [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/). It uses a modern headless architecture that enables developers to decouple front-end code from back-end systems. It leverages popular open-source libraries in the React ecosystem, such as [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) components, [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) (CSS-in-JS), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and many more.

Developers don’t have to worry about the underlying infrastructure, whether they’re developing their app locally, deploying it to a [Managed Runtime](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/mrt-overview.html) environment, or testing the app live.

## Requirements

-   Node 16.11 or later
-   npm 8 or later

## Get Started

To start your web server for local development, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm start
```

Now that the development server is running, you can open a browser and preview your commerce app:

-   Go to http://localhost:3000/

## Localization

See the [Localization README.md](./translations/README.md) for important setup instructions for localization.

## Configuration Files

The Retail React App's configuration files are located in the `app/config` folder. For more details, see [Configuration Files](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/configuration-options.html) in the documentation.

## Documentation

The full documentation for PWA Kit and Managed Runtime is hosted on the [Salesforce Developers](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/overview) portal.
